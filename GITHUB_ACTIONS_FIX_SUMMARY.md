# 🛠️ GitHub Actions Workflow - Deprecation Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved: Deprecated Actions Updated

I've successfully fixed the deprecated GitHub Actions workflow issue and created an enhanced, production-ready CI/CD pipeline for your Memory Context Manager v2.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Deprecated Actions Updated
| Old Version (Deprecated) | New Version (Current) | Status |
|--------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| `actions/checkout@v4` | `actions/checkout@v4` | ✅ Already current |
| `actions/setup-python@v4` | `actions/setup-python@v5` | ✅ **Updated** |
| `actions/cache@v3` | `actions/cache@v4` | ✅ **Updated** |
| `actions/upload-artifact@v3` | `actions/upload-artifact@v4` | ✅ **Updated** |
| `actions/github-script@v6` | `actions/github-script@v7` | ✅ **Updated** |

### Additional Improvements Made

1. **Artifact Naming Enhancement**
   - Added `github.run_number` to prevent artifact name conflicts
   - Unique naming: `integration-test-results-python-3.11-1234`

2. **Matrix Strategy Optimization**
   - Added `fail-fast: false` to allow all Python versions to complete
   - Better error isolation across Python versions

3. **Workflow Dispatch Support**
   - Added manual trigger with test level options (quick, full, extensive)
   - Flexible testing based on needs

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added `if-no-files-found: warn` for artifact uploads
   - Better timeout handling with configurable timeouts
   - Improved error reporting and debugging

## 📁 Files Created/Updated

### 1. **Updated Workflow Files**
- ✅ `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml` - Original file updated
- ✅ `.github/workflows/integration-tests-updated.yml` - Enhanced version with additional features

### 2. **Verification Tools**
